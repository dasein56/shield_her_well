    Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,
    And slowly rolled her eyes around;
    Then drawing in her breath aloud,
    Like one that shuddered, she unbound
    The cincture from beneath her breast:
    Her silken robe, and inner vest,
    Dropt to her feet, and full in view,
    Behold! her bosom, and half her side -
    A sight to dream of, not to tell!
    O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!

    Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;
    Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
    Deep from within she seems half-way
    To lift some weight with sick assay,
    And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
    Then suddenly as one defied
    Collects herself in scorn and pride,
    And lay down by the Maidenâ€™s side! -
    And in her arms the maid she took,
